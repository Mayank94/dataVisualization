1. Before running the code, please paste the Final Dataset folder to your desired location and then in the code please put the path of that location in os.chdir() function. Rest all
the paths will be taken up by the code

2. We have use JSON to plot the geographical plots, which were not captured properly by Google Colab when we tried to convert the Notebook to pdf, thus either run the code to check or refer
the outputs folder which contains proper screenshots of those outputs.

Thank You
